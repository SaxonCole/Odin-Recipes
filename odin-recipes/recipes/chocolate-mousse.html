    Chocolate mousse is a staple among chocolate desserts. It is very popular for all ages. Its texture is easy to recognize as it has a light, airy look, its chocolate flavor is intense and it's soft and melting on the palate.

<h3>ingredients</h3>
<p> 
    <ul>
        300g CADBURY Baking Dark Chocolate, roughly chopped
        </ul>
        <ul>3 eggs, at room temperature</ul>
  
<ul>
    1 tbsp good-quality cocoa powder, sifted
    </ul>
    <ul>
        300ml thickened cream, plus extra whipped cream to serve
        </ul>
      <ul>Grated chocolate, to serve
      </ul>
   


    <h2>Method</h2>
    <li>Place the chocolate
    
         in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water (don't let the bowl touch the water). Stir until melted. Remove bowl from heat and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
         <li>Place eggs and sugar in a large bowl and beat with electric beaters for 5 minutes, or until mixture is pale, thick and doubled in volume. Fold in cocoa powder and cooled chocolate until combined.</li>
         <li>In a separate bowl, whip cream until thickened (be careful not to over-beat). Use a large metal spoon to carefully fold the cream into the chocolate mixture, trying to keep the mixture as light as possible. Spoon into 6 serving glasses and chill in fridge for at least 1 hour. Remove from fridge 15 minutes before serving, then top with extra whipped cream and grated chocolate to serve.</li>
