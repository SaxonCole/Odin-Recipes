<h2>Traditional Mamas Lasagna</h2>
<p>
    Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>
</p>
<h3>ingredients</h3>
<p> 
    <ul>
        2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
        </ul>
        1 pound ground beef chuck
<ul>
        1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)
    </ul>
    <ul>
        1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)
        </ul>
        2 cloves garlic, minced
<ul>
    1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce
    </ul>
    <ul>
        3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)
        </ul>
        1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
<ul>
    2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano
    </ul>
    <ul>
        1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed
        </ul>
        1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar
<ul>
    Salt
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
    </li>
    <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
    </li>     
<li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
<li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</ol4>
